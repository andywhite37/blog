Hi, my name is Andy White, and this is my personal website.

I live in Erie, Colorado (near Boulder) with my wife and three kids, and I
work as a full-stack software developer.

I've lived in Colorado my whole life - I was born in Denver, grew up mostly
in Colorado Springs, and then bounced around the Denver metro area in my
adult life.

I attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, and studied
Electrical/Computer Engineering. After working in robotics, control systems,
and circuits labs in college, and frying my fair share of circuit boards and
components, I opted to pursue a career in software development rather than
electrical things. I love software development because all you need is a
computer, and you can do so many different things.

In my career, I've used a variety of languages, including C, C++, Perl, Java,
Python, C#, JavaScript, Haxe, Scala, PureScript, Haskell, and ReasonML. My
current interest is in pure, typed functional programming languages and
concepts. The world of functional programming has opened my eyes to so many
new and powerful concepts, I'm excited to continue learning, applying the
ideas, and growing my understanding.

In my spare time, I spend a lot of time with my wife and kids, and I enjoy
biking, playing guitar, and kayaking. (Or I'd like to enjoy those things if I
could find any spare time.)
